# PrestoQ

Here is my solution to the PrestoQ Android assignment (as specified here: https://github.com/prestoqinc/code-exercise-android). I've written the app in Kotlin and you can clone and load the project like any other Android project in Android Studio. I've included some unit tests which are located in ManagerSpecialAdapterTest. I extracted the logic to calculate the adjusted widths and heights into a class and these tests verify that the correct values are calculated. 

The completed project is under the master branch and everything you need to run the app should be there. I also created some branches and created pull requests for the different features of the assignment if you'd like to take a look as well. Otherwise, thanks for taking the time to look at my assignment! 

Here's what the app should look like:
